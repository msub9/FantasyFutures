    <p class="w3-justify">Hypothesis<br>
Here at Fantasy Futures, we seek to use advanced statistics and methods to forge a path to victory in any league, from any situation. We believe that with the right waiver-wire pickups and trades, you can push any team to become a league-winner. To find value on the waiver and in trades, we believe that looking at advanced statistics through various filters and angles provides the best outlook on potential value (and potential decreases in value).<br><br>
Methodology<br>
In the past, there has been quite a bit of research done on what stats correlate closely with fantasy football output and production by players. This article was used to determine what statistical measures were utilized and why they were given the weight that they were. Considering that there are many statistics that provide deeper insight into how football players can produce and why, it is worth putting them in a table to compare (or a graph to see how the statistic is trending for that player week by week). Utilizing this chart, we can find some statistics common to all the players that are worth looking into. Mainly, snaps, snap share, targets, and target share, along with red zone (RZ) and green zone (GZ) related statistics. From this, we can tell that the situations that enable football players to produce the best for fantasy football entail them being on the field, playing snaps, and running routes. Using this knowledge, we can create a weighted model that takes most of these statistics into account so that we can generate a better view of a player and their opportunities on the field in terms of fantasy football.
Data from Pro-Football-Reference.com and DailyRoto was used to make up the database of all players.

OverallRank = Rank when compared to all players.<br>
-9999 = Unique identifier for every player.<br>
Opportunities = Chances that a player has to make a play with the ball.<br>

Y/G = Yards per game. How many yards were produced by the player. Can be specified to be rushing yards per game or air/receiving yards per game.
Our own terminology:<br>
Player Score = Grades player attributes including snap share, total snap ranking, target share, average targets, yards per catch, red zone target share, rushing yards per game, and receiving yards per game.<br>
Quarterback Score = Grades player attributes based on the level of their quarterback. This includes their quarterback’s passer rating, yards per pass attempted, and completion percentage.<br>
Team Score = Grades player attributes based on the strength of the team’s offense and situation. Includes statistics such as team red zone scoring attempts per game, team PPG (points per game), team rushing yards per game, team receiving yards per game, and point differential.<br>
Opposing Team Score = Grades player attributes based on the matchup ahead. Utilizes stats of the opposing team’s defense, including PPG allowed, rushing yards allowed (for running backs), receiving yards allowed (for wide receivers and tight ends), blitz percentage, and pressure percentage.<br>
We believe that these four aspects, together, can show us all the aspects surrounding a player.
